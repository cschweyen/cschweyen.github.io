				<h1>Fall</h1>
				<p>Fall months are September, October, and November.</p>
				<p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons. 
				Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September or March, when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter 
				and the temperature cools considerably.</p>
				<h1>The Beautiful Changes</h1>
				<p>BY RICHARD WILBUR</p>
				<p>One wading a Fall meadow finds on all sides </p>  
				<p>The Queen Anne’s Lace lying like lilies</p>
				<p>On water; it glides</p>
				<p>So from the walker, it turns</p>
				<p>Dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you</p>
				<p>Valleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>The beautiful changes as a forest is changed </p>  
				<p>By a chameleon’s tuning his skin to it;   </p>
				<p>As a mantis, arranged</p>
				<p>On a green leaf, grows</p>
				<p>Into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves </p>  
				<p>Any greenness is deeper than anyone knows.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Your hands hold roses always in a way that says   </p>
				<p>They are not only yours; the beautiful changes   </p>
				<p>In such kind ways,   </p>
				<p>Wishing ever to sunder</p>
				<p>Things and things’ selves for a second finding, to lose   </p>
				<p>For a moment all that it touches back to wonder.</p>
