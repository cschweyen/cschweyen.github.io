					<h1>Good Websites</h1>
					<h3><a href="https://www.rei.com/">REI</a></h3>
						<p> I think REI has a good website. Their website is very clean, straight forward and easy to use. The theme 
						of the page matches the company and what they are selling, outdoor gear. I also like that they have a section of the homepage dedicated to what 
						other people in your area are buying, it adds a personal touch to the site. Also, the site is designed as mobile first which makes it easy to use 
						on a mobile device, which personally is where I tend to look on websites.</p>
						<p>The code on REI's page is clean, organized, and modern. The website did not use HTML5 elements troughout
						the code for the page, as far as I could tell. Though the code is modern I did not find any tables on the website.</p>
						<p>The layout of REI's website makes sense to me. The layout is clean, the homepage showcases the member and
						REI credit card's information, and easy acess to apply. The top has a navigation bar to take the user to the page that they are looking for, women's,
						men's, children's, and different pages for designated activies like yoga, climbing, hiking & camping, and many more. For a clothing and gear store
						the layout makes sense and it divided into easy to define categories. There is no scrolling effects on the pages, however.</p>
						<p>REI's page uses very few colors, primarily they use earthy colors like black, white, differnt shades of greys, browns, and tan. These colors portray
						what their company is about, being outdoors and enjoying nature. By just looking at the color scheme of the site it is easy for users to identify what 
						REI is about and what they are trying to sell.</p>
						<p>Not only is REI's page functional, it has little details that set it appart. For exapmle across the site there is little green tree illistrations, like 
						the one found in the footer of the homeage. Also, when the cursor hovers over the different activity names in the navigation bar they turn to green. To go
						along with the last part on the top of the page where it has the navigation bar with shop REI, REI outlet, used gear, etc. after one of those elements is
						selected and it takes the user to that page, in the navigation bar in the page that the user is on, the words are undelined white with two mountian peaks.</p>
						
					
					<h3><a href="https://www.dfwairport.com/">DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) Airport</a></h3>
						<p> The DFW Airport's website is very simplistic. It is good that it is simplistic because usually 
						when a person would be going to use their website, they have very specific questions, and/or little time to find it. Another good thing about
						their website is that in this time of crisis surrounding the COVID-19 virus, the homepage there is a clearly marked image about updates for the
						airport. To go along with the simplistic design of the page, it keeps the design clean and professional looking while still being functional.</p>
						<p>The DFW website has code that is clearly organized, and looks modern. They do not use HTML5 elements in the code, that I could find at least.
						On the page the departing, and arriving flights pages appeared to be tables, but when looking at the code I did not find any that was coding the
						directories as tables.</p>
						<p>The page's layout makes sense for the servies that they are providing. The website is minimal and when the user first opens the website they can
						easily find what they are looking for. There is two tabs at the top "passangers" and "business and careers", this way when someone logs onto the page
						they can find quickly what they re looking for. Under the passangers tab it has flight status, before you fly, and at DFW airport; this makes it 
						incredibly easy for the user to locate the information they are looking for in a timely matter, which is important becuase the typical user of this
						site is a passanger and they need the information that they are looking for as fast as they can get to it. Therefore the layout on this page makes
						sense.</p>
						<p>This page uses very minimal colors consiting of mostly orange, white, and greys. By using these colors the site is remaining very simplistic while 
						still offering small pops of color throughout. This is important becuase the colors are not distracting to the user, but are still visually appealing.
						I do think the colors match the service, for the most part, instead of oragne I think a better choice would have been blue, but I do think the orange
						is a good fit for this website</p>
						<p>What sets this site appart from others is that it has lots of white space which makes it easy to read. The design is simplistic but the icons that
						they have to show each section of the site make sense for each page. I think that this website is very effective in what they are trying to give users,
						while not making it hard to navigate the information, or to extravegant that it hard to find what the user is looking for.</p>
						
					<h1>Bad Website</h1>
					<h3><a href="https://www.leilanislattes.com/">Leilani's Lattes</a></h3>
						<p>This website is not the worst one that I hav ever seen, but it does have several flaws that I think make it a bad website. First, when the site is used on
						a mobile device the desgin is all over the place and the order does not make logical sense, when the site is opened on a PC its layout is much better and makes
						sense. Also the colors do not match the logo of the coffee shop, the colors do somewhat match the astetic of a coffee shop. Along with those reasons the site is
						food and drink menus are hard to read and know what they are trying to say. Some of the images are not well aligned within thier pages.</p>
						<p>The code for this site is somewhat organized, but it is not modern, and makes little sense. This site does not use HTML5 elements, as far as I could tell.
						There is no tables on this site, but it does have a navigation bar to explore the site.</p>
						<p>Despite everything else this pages layout does make sense, for the most part. The page has a clear navigation bar and all the items on the homepage are
						important and have a purpose there. One thing that I would change is in the navigation to put the food and drink menus onto one tab and call it "menu" with
						more description of what each item is.</p>
						<p>The colors on this site do not match the product or company at all. The main colors used are black, a greenish yellow, and white. I think the colors they
						are using now do slightly match the theme that a coffee shop would try to use but they are too dark for this specific shop. The companies logo is white,
						teal, and pink, which are more fun colors. I think that this website would be better off if they chose more nuertal colors of white, grey, and tan or brown, but 
						at the same time incorperated fun pops of color to match their logo and how they are trying to market their coffee shops.</p>
						<p>There are a few things bwsides color that I would change on this website. Like I mentioned earlier I would consolidate the menu pages into one menu of 
						both food and drinks then I would add a short description of each item so the customer knew a little bit about each item; another thing I would change on the
						menu is putting the prices for each food item and size beverage next to the it on the menu in columns. For exapmple I would have a food menu with a clear title
						and a beverage menu, on the beverage menu I would have coluns titled Beverage, 12 oz, 16 oz, and 20 oz and for each beverage next to the name and under its
						proper size I would put the price. Also on the drink menu currently there is a button to email in your order, I would move the button to a diifernt place on the
						menu tab that made more sense than in the middle. Additionally on the happy hour page I would get a new image and ceter it within the lines, if I kept the image
						I would also center it between the lines instead of having it go on the top of them. The page also showcases a gallry page, I would make it so that when people
						shared images on social media they would appear on that page and when the cursor hovered over the images the captions would appear, similar to what they have now
						with the image names; but if the owner wanted to keep only the images that are on there now I would sugest when the user hovers the images with thier cursor that 
						a description of the images shows up instead of the words, and image names that appear now. Another thing that I would change is having the companies logo at the 
						top of the page instead of just typing out "Leilani's Lattes". Overall I think this website works but with just a few minor fixes it could be even better.</p>
