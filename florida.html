			<h1>About Florida</h1>
				<p>Florida is the southeasternmost U.S. state, with the Atlantic on one side and the Gulf of Mexico on the other. It has hundreds of miles of beaches.
				The city of Miami is known for its Latin-American cultural influences and notable arts scene, as well as its nightlife, especially in upscale South Beach. 
				Orlando is famed for theme parks, including Walt Disney World.</p>
			<h1>Climate</h1>
				<p>The climate has always been Florida's most important natural resources, which is reflected in its official nickname, the "Sunshine State." Summers throughout 
				the state are long, very warm, and fairly humid; and, daily thunderstorms are the norm. Winters are mild with periodic invasions of cool to occasionally cold air.</p>
